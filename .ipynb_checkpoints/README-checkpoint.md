# *In vivo* enzymology

This repository contains all data and models used in the following publication:

Combining systems and synthetic biology for in vivo enzymology. Casta√±o-Cerezo et al., 2024, bioRxiv preprint, doi: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578620

The model used to run simulations is provided in the folder 'model'. This model is also available from the Biomodels database (with identifier MODEL2407240001).

The code used to quantify in vivo enzymatic parameters can be found in the Jupyter notebook 'enzinvivo.ipynb'.

All the figures can be found in the folder 'figures'.
